### Hi there 👋
**Why am I here?** To support You with with your everyday life tasks when you're working with your computer (🖥) and... to make it  **personal** again.

Have you noticed PC aka "personal computer" nowadays is no longer "personal"? Plenty of decisions are now taken by operating system developers without even informing us, users.  One day I realised that I can work more efficiently paying just couple minutes of my attention to how and what I am actually doing.

My name is Maciej Słojewski aka słonik (🐘 in Polish) and I'm here to share with you some 🍇🍈🍉 of my work. I'm writing in AutoHotkey language, which belongs to Robotics Process Automation (RPA) tools.

Some basic ideas:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on "Hotstrings" application which enable to create text abbreviations (aka triggerstrings) and corresponding expansions.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to boosting everyday efficiency.
- 📫 How to reach me: just drop me an 📧 or find me on Signal instant messenger.
- 👍 How can you support me: my account on Patreon [Patreon][]
